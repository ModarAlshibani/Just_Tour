#JustTour
🚀 Excited to share a project I’ve been passionately working on! 🌍✨  

I’m thrilled to announce the completion of the front-end development for a tourism facilitation app named JustTour designed to enhance the travel experience in Syria. Built using 
Flutter, this app aims to connect tourists with local tour groups, making it easier to discover, book, and participate in various trips and activities across the country.  

What does the app do?
- For Tourists:  Easily browse and book trips, follow tour groups, and explore tourist sites.  
- For Tour Groups: Manage trips, track bookings, and engage with participants seamlessly.  
- For Everyone: A user-friendly interface with features like e-wallet integration, real-time notifications, and trip ratings.  

This project was a collaborative effort, and I’m proud to have contributed to the Flutter-based front-end, ensuring a smooth, responsive, and visually appealing experience for users. The app is designed to promote tourism in Syria by creating a community-driven platform that connects travelers with local experiences.  

Tech Stack:  
- Front-End: Flutter (Dart)  
- Back-End: Laravel (PHP)  
- Database: MySQL  

What’s next?
We’re already thinking about future enhancements, such as offline access, live streaming for trip updates, and even more interactive features to make travel planning even better.  

A huge shoutout to my amazing team for their hard work and dedication! 🙌
